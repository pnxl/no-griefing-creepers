This datapack disables creeper griefing without needing to disable `mobGriefing`.

### Why not disable `mobGriefing`?
Disabling `mobGriefing` comes with several disadvantages, such as:
- Blaze fireballs creating fire
- Rabbits eating crops
- Sheep eating grass blocks
- Silverfish calling for help out of nearby blocks destroying said blocks
- Silverfish hiding in stone (Silverfish will not reinhabit stone blocks after roaming)
- Snowmen leaving snow traces
- Villagers harvesting/replanting farmland
- Villagers not being able to pick up bread
- etc.

This datapack only disables creeper griefing without disabling any of those other things.
